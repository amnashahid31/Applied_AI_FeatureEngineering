# Applied_AI_FeatureEngineering
Assignment for Applied AI

This is repository contains an assignment for the course Applied Artificial Intelligence. The assignment is actually about predicting the expected gap values between the demand and the supply chain. This was done using different AI techniques, and above them all is Feature Engineering.

The Assignment is completed in Python language. The first and foremost step for this was "data formating" after that we extracted our desired columns and data which helped further in feature engineering.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate regression models for predicting the supply-demand gap in ride-hailing services. With the enormous amount of data generated by companies like Uber, accurate forecasting becomes crucial for optimizing driver allocation and ensuring customer satisfaction. By employing various regression techniques and evaluating their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²), we aim to identify the most effective model for predicting demand surges and guiding resource allocation efficiently.

**Main Steps Involved:**

**Data Pre-processing:**

• Merge order data with cluster map data to obtain region IDs.

• Convert the "Time" column to datetime format.

• Create time slots based on a defined interval (e.g., 10 minutes).

• Calculate demand (total number of orders) and supply (fulfilled orders) for each region and time slot.

• Handle missing values by filling missing supply values with 0 and calculating the gap between demand and supply.

• Split data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

**Machine Learning Models:**

• Implement Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), and Decision Tree Regression models.

• Train each model using the training data.

• Predict the gap for the test data using the trained models.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

• Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) to assess model performance.

• Visualize results for model comparison.

**Predicted Value:**

Predict the gap for a specific region ID, day, and time slot using the best-performing model.

**Results:**
Based on the evaluation metrics, Decision Tree Regression outperforms Linear Regression and KNN Regression in terms of accuracy. It has the lowest MAE and RMSE values and the highest R-squared value, indicating superior performance in explaining the variance in the data.

**Conclusion:**
Decision Tree Regression emerges as the most effective model for predicting the supply-demand gap. Its ability to accurately forecast demand surges can significantly enhance driver utilization and customer experience, leading to improved service reliability and customer satisfaction.
